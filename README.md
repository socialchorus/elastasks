## Background

This application attempts to solve the problem detailed in the [unresolved Kibana issue #42621](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/42621):

> Long-running tasks can leak processes and kill a cluster. Users need a way to detect slow queries and kill these tasks. We can start down the road of addressing this problem by building a ‚ÄúTasks‚Äù app that show a list of all tasks that are running, indicate ones that are cancellable, display any available information that the API provides, and give users the ability to cancel these tasks.

## Getting Started

On the web:

Locally using workstation:

1. `sc start tasky`

2. When connecting to an ElasticSearch host you need to opt out of enabling [CorsAnywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/) -- a NodeJS reverse proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied request.  It's not needed to connect to Elasticsearch in AWS.

Without workstation:

1. `yarn install && yarn start`
2. Browse to localhost:4200
